# Rapid Insert Plugin for Figma

---

Rapid Insert is a plugin for Figma that simplifies the prototyping process by allowing users to quickly search for and clone components from other pages within the same file and insert them directly onto the current page. This eliminates the need to manually copy and paste components, saving time and increasing efficiency in the design process. Rapid Insert is intuitive and easy to use, making it the perfect tool for streamlining your workflow and boosting productivity.
